Machine Learning Assignment - Flight Delay Prediction
# Airline Delay – Data Preprocessing

This repository contains data preprocessing work for a machine learning assignment.

## Dataset
Airline Delay dataset from Kaggle.

## Tasks Completed
- Data Cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates)
- Data Transformation (encoding and scaling)
- Data Reduction (feature selection using SelectKBest)

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook


## Pipeline Integration
An end-to-end regression pipeline was implemented to integrate data preprocessing,
train-test splitting, multiple regression models, and evaluation using RMSE and R².

## Models Integrated
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- KNN Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor

## Reproducibility
Random seeds were fixed to ensure consistent and repeatable results.
