Machine Learning Assignment - Flight Delay Prediction
# Airline Delay – Data Preprocessing

This repository contains data preprocessing work for a machine learning assignment.

## Dataset
Airline Delay dataset from Kaggle.

## System Pipeline Overview
The project follows a complete machine learning pipeline:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Train–test splitting
- Model training using multiple regression algorithms
- Model evaluation using RMSE and R² metrics
- Result validation and comparison

## Models Integrated
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- KNN Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor


## Tasks Completed
- Integrated preprocessing, data splitting, and model training into a single
  executable pipeline
- Ensured consistent train–test splits across all models
- Validated model outputs and data flow
- Fixed integration issues and ensured end-to-end execution
- Ensured reproducibility by fixing random seeds



## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook



## Reproducibility
Random seeds and random_state vales were fixed to ensure consistent and repeatable results across multiple runs.
